# Ballistics Test

This is a simple ballistics demo developed with C++ and SDL2 in which I experiment with writing a ballistics physics engine. The demo consists of a simple cannon which can fire different projectiles across a field.

## Compiling

note: makefile uses GCC.

1) clone to a new directory
2) make mkdirs
3) make

Executable will be saved to bin directory created with 'make mkdirs'

run 'make clean' to erase the bin directory.
